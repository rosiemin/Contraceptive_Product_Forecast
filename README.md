## Main Study Question:

Given contraceptive consumption data from the public sector health system in CÃ´te D'Ivore (Ivory Coast), can I forecast consumption made monthly over the subsequent three months, July 2019, August, 2019, and September 2019.

## Motivation and Background:

Understanding the public health sector, especially in low- and middle-income countries, can help provide vital information to governments and communities where the need is greatest. The use and access to contraceptives enables individuals and couples to take control over their own ability to have children. Additionally, access to fertility care helps enable communities, families, and individuals better healthcare outcomes. 

Most of these low- and middle-income countries have been relying on outdated inventory systems, impacting communities when stock is too low or stock is too high and expires. Reliable availability of health commodities is fundamental to diagnosing and treating illness in primary healthcare settings. Trying to use, up-to-date machine learning (ML) methods can help alleviate the burdens that these outdated methods can have on the healthcare delivery systems [Agarwal, et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491065/). 

The goal of this study is to determine whether or not ML forecasting can provide more accurate inventories, predicting where stock will be needed based on historical data. This will lead to more efficient healthcare delivery, allowing the healthcare professionals in these areas to focus on treating and saving lives, rather than worrying about what their site may need.

## The Data

This data came in multiple `.csv` files, including:
* `Train.csv`- captures contraceptive inventory and distribution at the health service delivery site level. This data spans from **January 2016 - June 2019** It includes features such as:
    * `stock_distributed` - the outcome of interest here
    * `product_code` - the contraceptive product ID
    * `site_code` - the public health service delivery site ID
    * Other stock variables, including `initial_stock`, `stock_received`, `average_monthly_consumption`, and a few others
* `contraceptive_case_data_annual.csv` - captures data pertaining to contraceptive use aggregated annually at the site level for 2016, 2017, and 2018
* `contraceptive_case_data_monthly.csv` - captures data pertaining to contraceptive use aggregated monthly at the site level for Jan 2019 - Sept 2019
* `service_delivery_site_data.csv` - health service delivery site information
* `product.csv` - contraceptive product information

** Note: All graphs shown here are examining the data at a YYYY/MM level, collapsing product ID and site ID into an aggregated sum. Model selection was based on the individual product x site level, however data was too granular to show all that in this summary. see [this `.py` file]() for more information **
